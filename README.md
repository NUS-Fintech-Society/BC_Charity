# Charity

Charities need your support, and we want to help them give you full confidence in your donations.
With our blockchain solution, charities can publicly and irrevocably commit the reciept of the donation for the world to see.
Donors can rest easy knowing that their donation was recieved and is accounted for as a matter of public record.
Never again will donors have doubts about being scammed or wonder if the donation they made really went to the charity of their choice.
